MTLLoadActionDontCare
Each pixel in the attachment is allowed to take on any value at the start of the rendering pass.

MTLLoadActionLoad
The existing contents of the texture are preserved.

MTLLoadActionClear
A value is written to every pixel in the specified attachment.


CAMetalDrawable表示一个可显示的缓冲区，该缓冲区提供一个符合MTLTexture协议的对象，该协议可用于为Metal创建渲染目标。

  注意：CAMetalLayer维护用于显示的内部纹理池。 为了将纹理重新用于新的CAMetalDrawable，必须释放任何先前的CAMetalDrawable并呈现另一个CAMetalDrawable。


renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].loadAction
在渲染过程开始时使用此附件执行的操作。 默认值为MTLLoadActionDontCare，除非由creation或init方法指定。



MTLView---------------------

The view requires a MTLDevice object so that it can create and manage Metal objects internally. Your app must set the device and, optionally, modify the view’s drawable properties before drawing. The MTKView class supports three drawing modes:

The default mode automatically invokes a redraw based on an internal timer. In this case, both isPaused and enableSetNeedsDisplay are automatically set to false.

The second mode invokes a redraw from a view notification, which is usually a call to setNeedsDisplay(). In this case, both isPaused and enableSetNeedsDisplay must be set to true.

The third mode invokes a redraw when the draw() method is explicitly called. In this case, isPaused must be set to true and enableSetNeedsDisplay must be set to false.

For all of these drawing modes, when a redraw is requested, either draw(_:) from a subclassed instance of the view is called, or draw(in:) from the view’s delegate is called. You should either subclass MTKView or provide a delegate, but not both.
